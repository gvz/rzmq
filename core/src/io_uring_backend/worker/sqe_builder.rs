/// Builds an SQE for an external UringOpRequest if it maps to a direct kernel call.
///
/// # Arguments
/// * `request`: The external operation request.
/// * `out_connect_fd`: If the request is `Connect`, this will be populated with the
///   `RawFd` of the socket created for the connect attempt. This FD is needed by
///   the `cqe_processor` to manage the socket (e.g., close it on connect failure).
/// * `_ring_features_has_ext_arg`: Example of passing ring features if needed by specific opcodes.
///
/// # Returns
/// * `Ok(Some(squeue::Entry))` if an SQE was successfully built.
/// * `Ok(None)` if the operation does not produce a direct SQE from this function
///   (e.g., `InitializeBufferRing`, `Listen` setup, `StartFdReadLoop`, etc., which are
///   handled by worker state changes or by handlers).
/// * `Err(UringOpCompletion::OpError)` if building the SQE failed (e.g., syscall error
///   during socket creation for Connect) or if the request type is unhandled here but
///   was expected to produce an SQE.
