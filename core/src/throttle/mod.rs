//! An adaptive, probabilistic throttle for managing I/O fairness in async actors.
//!
//! This module provides an `AdaptiveThrottle` that allows an actor to balance its
//! time between different workloads (e.g., incoming vs. outgoing data) without
//! explicit, complex scheduling logic in the actor itself.
//!
//! # Model
//!
//! The throttle uses a "DEBT/CREDIT" system, represented by a single `balance`
//! counter.
//! - **Ingress** (work coming in) adds to the balance, creating "debt."
//! - **Egress** (work going out) subtracts from the balance, paying it off.
//!
//! The throttle learns the normal operating balance for a given workload and only
//! intervenes when the system deviates significantly from this learned norm. The
//! intervention is a probabilistic `yield`, giving other tasks a chance to run.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! The API is designed around a simple, two-step cycle for each I/O operation:
//!
//! 1.  Call `throttle.begin_work()` before the operation to get a `ThrottleGuard`.
//!     This performs an anticipatory update to the throttle's state.
//! 2.  After the operation, call `guard.should_throttle().await`. This will
//!     run the probabilistic logic and potentially yield to the async runtime.
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! // Inside an actor's select! loop arm
//!
//! // 1. Announce the work and get the guard.
//! let guard = self.throttle.begin_work(Direction::Ingress);
//!
//! // 2. Do the I/O work. The outcome is not tracked by the throttle.
//! self.handle_incoming_message(message).await;
//!
//! // 3. Finalize the cycle, potentially yielding.
//! guard.should_throttle().await;
//! ```
