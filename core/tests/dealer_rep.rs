/// The expected message flow is:
/// 1. DEALER sends [payload]. The socket implementation prepends an empty delimiter frame,
///    so the wire format is [empty_delimiter(MORE), payload(NOMORE)].
/// 2. REP receives the message. Its socket implementation processes the envelope (the empty delimiter)
///    and presents only the payload to the application via `recv()`.
/// 3. REP sends [reply_payload]. The socket implementation prepends the saved routing envelope,
///    so the wire format is [empty_delimiter(MORE), reply_payload(NOMORE)].
/// 4. DEALER receives the message. Its socket implementation strips the empty delimiter
///    and presents only the reply_payload to the application via `recv()`.
